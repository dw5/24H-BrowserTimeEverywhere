# BrowserTime
Extension to change from 12 hour to 24 hour format.
Text Input fields (like search engine or anywhere else) are not touched

Website will be ~~fixed~~ edited within half of 1 second (500ms)

There might be some JavaScript errors thrown, might not work everywhere, but seems to work not that terribly...
